# FON Hackathon 2021 - Winning Application

### About

We built this app over the weekend during the 8th annual FON Hackathon in Belgrade, Serbia, lasting from 9th to 11th of April, 2021. We ended up winning the first prize after hours of sleeplessness and hours and hours of coding and tonnes of coffee and energy drinks.

Written in React Native +  Laravel, the app's main purpose is to help people during dangerous and unpredictable natural disasters such as floods, earthquakes, fires, etc... You're welcome to take a look at the code and copy it and change it to your liking and even distribute your modified versions as long as you comply with the license agreement outlined in the LICENSE file.
